# What this is

This is a document I wrote for Master's level Financial Mathematics students
correcting an error in their textbook regarding calculating standard error when
taking correlated samples.

Had a tough time getting the pictures (with their gnuplot fonts) to blend
nicely with the LaTeX stylings, so I hacked together a little something with
the psfrag package, and this made things complicated so I added a Makefile to
the mix.

The final document is `correlated_paths.pdf`
